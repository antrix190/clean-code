# Matchsticks

A very simple command line game. The original code is not too long but it is buggy, unreadable and it is not easy to add a new feature. Simply said, it is a piece of legacy code you can improve your refactoring skills with.

You can find the rules in the original article (check resources!)

## Steps to complete

Each step should fit in 45-60 minutes.

- Get to know the code, run it a few times, write some end-to-end tests
- Try to make modules, extract methods, classes from the code
- Write unit tests
- Rethink style, rename variables, change used data structures
- Refactor matchsticks drawing and communication with user, deal with error messages

## Languages

- [C++](C++)
- [Java](Java)
- [JavaScript](JavaScript)
- [Kotlin](Kotlin)

## Contributions

Feel free to add a new language to the list. Please try to keep the original mistakes, structure, so that everyone can work on the "exact same" bugs, making similar improvements.

Don't forget to modify this README file and please add another README to the new folder. It should contain information on the tools needed and the steps how to run the code.
